## Introduction  

#### About This Project

#### About Me
Developer, Designer Be creative!! Currently Studying [@42SiliconValley][42]

#### About 42  
[42][42] is a free, non profit, project-based, peer-to-peer learning coding school. It originated in France and now has over 20 campuses all over the world. More information can be found [here][42] 

## Objective  

## Instructions
Make sure you have the needed [dependencies](#dependencies) before proceeding.
For instructions and/or greater detail refer to the project [pdf][pdf]
## Mandatory part
- [ ] create a 00_how_to_docker folder in which you will push the solutions for all exercises
- [ ] Check that docker version prints out your current docker version, and that you have
at least the 1.12 docker
- [ ] Answer 34 exercise questions 
- [ ] Create a 01_dockerfiles folder in which you’ll store all the Dockerfiles that you’ll need later, in separate folders (ex00 / ex01 ...).
- [ ] Exercise 00: vim/emacs
- [ ] Exercise 01: BYOTSS
- [ ] Exercise 02: Dockerfile in a Dockerfile... in a Dockerfile ?
- [ ] Exercise 03: ... and bacon strips ... and bacon strips ...
## Bonus part
You can create your future work environments, such as:
- [ ] A developing environment to code in nodejs, but using yarn rather than npm
- [ ] PAMP (!) with docker-compose, but using MariaDB rather thanMySQL
- [ ] Recreate a full MEAN Stac
- [ ] Specific Dockerfiles for your C, Ruby, Go, Ocaml, Rust... projects
- [ ] etc.
Keep in mind that you have seen nothing yet of the full power of Docker. You could
for instance
- [ ] Try to containerize a VPN configuration for your containers
- [ ] Try to cluster several machines on different cloud services with Docker Swarm
- [ ] Start the construction of a base image, make your own debian or archlinux container.
- [ ] Containerize the server of your favorite game, like Minecraft (?)
- [ ] etc.
- [ ] Whatever you decide to do, we expect you to store everything that’s relevant in the
02_bonus folder of your repository.

## Dependencies  
* A C language compiler most common would be GCC or Clang.
* These were written to run on Unix based systems, it would likely work on a windows machine too but is currently untested.

### Warning For 42 Students

This is not kept up to date and I cannot guarantee that it will work on your future machines. You are welcome to use and learn from this as you want, but do not implement code that you do not understand. Copying is not the way.
